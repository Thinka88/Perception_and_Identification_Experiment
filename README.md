# Perception and Identification Experiment

This repository contains a replicated perception and identification experiment as well as all our collected data, analysis and writing.

## Experiment

In this experiment the participants are randomly assigned to an identification or discrimination task.

In the discrimination condition, the participants are shown the stimuli: matrices without separation gap. Their task is then to discriminate the two halves by indicating whether a separating line should be placed horizontally or vertically.

In the identification condition, the presented stimuli are matrices with a horizontally or vertically oriented gap, separating the random half from the non random one. The task is then to decide which of the two halves was more likely generated by a random process.
